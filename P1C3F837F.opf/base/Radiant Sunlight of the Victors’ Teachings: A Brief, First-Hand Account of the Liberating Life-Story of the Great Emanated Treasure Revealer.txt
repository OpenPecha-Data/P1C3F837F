Radiant Sunlight of the Victors’ Teachings

A Brief, First-Hand Account of the Liberating Life-Story of the Great Emanated Treasure Revealer

by Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa

To the sublime masters who have guided me on
The path to liberation, I pay homage!

Thanks to the compassion of Pema Tötreng Tsal,Who looked after me through my successive lifetimes,I
have obtained the supreme freedoms and riches,[1] joined the Buddha’s teachings,And,
driven by karmic propensities, coursed in the Dharma of Treasures.

Until the age of thirty-five, under obscurations’ influence,My childish mind made me inconstant
in view and behavior.Now that I am somewhat familiar with the nature of mind,I make sure
that my view and conduct always conform to the Dharma.

In my present situation, then, why am I writing my life story?Well, it is so as not to disappoint
the faithful.

In the vicinity of Namkha Dzö,[2] I entered human existence.At the foot of Sangyel,[3] I was
born from my mother’s womb.At the foot of Yegyel,[4] I was raised and grew up,And in Yarkhilné,[5]
the wish for Dharma arose.

My guiding Master, Künzang Choktrül[6] gave me the refuge vows,And thus I crossed the threshold
into the Buddha’s teachings.I obtained authorization[7] for White Tārā and the Peaceful
Guru.In Shedrup Ling,[8] I met with Tsewang Trinlé and,[9]During the preparation for the
Guru empowerment, feeling intense faith,I had a vision of the guru, who in his kindness bestowed
the four empowerments.

In my home area, Könchok Döndrup[10] and othersActed as my tutors and taught me to read and
write.Instructed by Tengyé,[11] I did my first retreat,Practicing the approach for White Tārā
and the Peaceful Guru.From the mantra-holder Rikdzin Pal,[12] I received practical instructionsFor
mantric rituals, and then headed to Central Tibet.

I saw then that I was under the care of the three roots,And a mantrika guru pacified an illness-causing
spirit.In Palmé[13] monastery, I stayed as a monastic recruit[14]Under the care
of Lord Chönyi Norbu.[15]I obtained empowerments and instructions[16] for the Eight Pronouncements
of the Sugatas,[17]And trained well in the practices of ritual dance, maṇḍala proportions,
and melodies.

For ten years, I joined the monastic assembly of Tsechu monastery,[18]And sublime masters bestowed
upon me countless empowerments and instructions.[19]I trained in everything from the
highest Great PerfectionDown to the simplest dance,And I realized the immense kindness of
my preceptors and instructors.

From Tendzin Chöki Wangpo[20] I receivedDirect instructions for Mahāmudrā and Dzokchen andThe
pith instructions of sublime masters onThe Heart Essence of the Great Perfection suffused
my heart.

I trained in the Nyingma melodies and dances from Püntsok Ling,[21]And received ordination from
the great Vinaya-holder, Taklung Rinpoché,[22]Who taught me the way of monkhood.[23]This
incomparable protector, supreme emanation,[24]Gave me the ripening empowerment forRatna
Lingpa’s Guru Heart Practice.[25]

In Nabün Dzong,[26] I met with Chögyel Dorjé,[27]Who gave me the secret pith instructions and
taught me the Great Perfection.

Following the command of the protector of beings, Situ Pema Nyinjé,[28]Venerable Tendzin Namgyel
bestowed upon me The Guru’s Heart Practice.[29]Following the master’s command, I then
went to Pelpung Monastery[30]And encountered the second Maitreya.[31]

Offering my undivided faith to the graciousNgédön Tendzin Rapgyé,[32] I received the bodhicitta
vows.From then on, I received many empowerments and instructions,And in particular, cut
through all my misconceptions of the view.

Jamgön Lama Kongtrül Rinpoché bestowed upon meEmpowerments, tantric explanations, and the ultimate
pith instructions.The omniscient master Jamyang Khyentsé gave meBoundless empowerments
and instructions, quintessence of the profound truth.These three were the masters who
showed me the threefold kindness.[33]

From the supreme emanation, Zurmang Tendzin,[34]I received the ripening empowerment forThe Assembly
of Sugatas of the Eight Pronouncements.[35]

Moreover, I relied on many other gracious masters,Such as Gajé Sang-Ngak Tendzin[36]And Tendzin
Jangchup Nyima,[37]And received many sacred teachings.When I received explanations on
sūtras and tantras fromJamyang Ngédön Kewang Zhendön,[38] my consciousness was liberated.


I revealed profound Treasures in the sight of all,Received their empowerments in visions,And
applied them in my own experience.

The omniscient Lord Karmapa,The eminent Sakya,[39] protector of beings,The Lord Drukchen,[40]
and many noble beingsOf the Drigung and Taklung lineages,[41]Practiced this sacred Dharma,
and thusThese profound Treasure teachings spread far and wide.

A great number of scholars and practitioners became my disciples;They nurtured the Buddhadharma
of both teaching and practice.The three masters of Riwoché[42]—the teacher and disciple
Jédrung[43] and Phakchok,[44]Along with Zhapdrung—gave me property andThe following sites
were established:

The Palace of Secret Mantra in Akaniṣṭha Karma,[45]Namkha Dzö, the Unchanging Sanctuary of Neten
Chok,[46]Pema Shelpuk in the sacred site of Dzomnang,[47]And the mountain hermitage on
Turquoise Lake in Gyamgyel Glacial Slopes.[48]Thus initiating teachings of both exegesis
and practice,With the kind support of the omniscient guru Khyentsé Wangpo,I then performed
many Great Accomplishments—Drupchens—the foundation of the teachings.

These good deeds are now recorded in one place—I have no qualities other than this.My greatest
virtue has been doing three-year retreat,And now too, I focus entirely on pure altruistic
intention.

Many years have passed since the mantra holder, Pema Düdül[49]Requested these words from Gyamgigül.[50]This
year, he overcame the hardship of our remotenessAnd, so as not to disappoint
his efforts, I wrote this downOn the tenth day of the seventh month of the Bull year,[51]In
Yangdzong Ling[52] and Namkha Dzö.

I dedicate this virtue so that all beings may reach awakening—May the blazing splendor of auspiciousness
adorn the world!
